This is experimental, community-supported Windows port of MicroPython.
It is based on Unix port, and expected to remain so.
The port requires additional testing, debugging, and patches. Please
consider to contribute.


To cross-compile under Debian/Ubuntu Linux system:

sudo apt-get install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime
make CROSS_COMPILE=i586-mingw32msvc-


To compile under Cygwin:

Install following packages using cygwin's setup.exe: mingw-gcc-g++ make
make CROSS_COMPILE=i686-pc-mingw32-


To compile using Visual Studio 2013:

Open micropython.vcxproj and build


To compile using Visual Studio 2013 commandline:

msbuild micropython.vcxproj


To run on Linux using Wine:

Default build (MICROPY_USE_READLINE=1) uses extended Windows console
functions and thus should be run using "wineconsole" tool. Depending
on Wine build configuration, you may also want to select curses backend
which has look&feel of a standard Unix console:

    wineconsole --backend=curses ./micropython.exe

For more info, see https://www.winehq.org/docs/wineusr-guide/cui-programs

If built without line editing and history capabilities
(MICROPY_USE_READLINE=0), the resulting binary can be built using standard
"wine" tool.
